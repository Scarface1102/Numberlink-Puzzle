# Numberlink Game Puzzle

This C++ program creates a random game board for the popular puzzle game Numberlink.

Numberlink is a type of logic puzzle involving finding paths to connect numbers in a grid.

The player has to pair up all the matching numbers on the grid with single continuous lines (or paths). The lines cannot branch off or cross over each other, and the numbers have to fall at the end of each line.

The code builds the puzzle board on a grid whose size is entered by the user.
It generates the maximum possible number of paths and numbers them.
It then shows the puzzle/gameboard generated.
The program also gives a possible solution for the generated puzzle.

Issue : Board print formatting is a bit off for 2-digit and above grid size values.
